## Intro

The Skyward (Aerial) Wind Knight is a melee dps with a unique mechanic where you stay in the air half the time during combat. While in the air you can avoid a lot of gound based patterns and boss attacks. The class has great AOE damage and respectable single target damage, but it lacks any sort of interrupt or mob grouping abilities.

This class uses strength gear, which is the same type of gear both tank classes use. If you also want to play tank along side this class without too much min maxing on the tank, then you would only need to farm a tank weapon and be good to go.

This class is not the top dps class, if you want to play a top dps class I recommend you play Marksman (Bow) instead.

## Skills

### TLDR: Advance Order (the one that uses skill books)

[Instant Edge](#instant-edge) > [Galeform](#galeform) > [Skyfall](#skyfall) >>> [Falcon Toss](#falcon-toss) = [Sharp Impact](#sharp-impact) >>> Basic attack = Ult

For skill upgrade (the one that cost bound luno) just upgrade everything to max

### Basic Attack (Left click)

- Advance Priority: no need to upgrade
- Bascially never use this skill with proper rotation.

### Skyfall
![](./assets/rmb.png)

- Advance Priority: 3
- Main skill to generate [Sharp stacks](#sharp) and to proc [Chasing Step](#chasing-step).

### Typhoon Cleave
![](./assets/r.png)

- Advance Priority: no need to upgrade
- Used for regenerate [Courage](#courage), not used for damage.

### Falcon Toss
![](./assets/q.png)

- Advance Priority: 4
- Generally not used in regular rotation, only use once per [Wind Fury](#wind-fury) when Azure Sever is available.

### Instant Edge
![](./assets/e.png)

- Advance Priority: 1
- This is one of the main damage source for the class, consumes [Sharp stacks](#sharp) on cast, and consumes [Chasing Step Stack](#chasing-step) on hit.
- This skill is also how you recharge [Sharp Impact](#sharp-impact).
- During [Wind Fury](#wind-fury) this skill will generate [Tornado](#tornado) on hit.
    - If skill is used while in the air 1 [Tornado](#tornado) will be generated.
    - If skill is used while standing on the ground 2 [Tornados](#tornado) will be generated, but animation will be longer.
- This skill is used to proc [Instant Edge Combo](#instant-edge-combo-node).

### Galeform
![](./assets/4.png)

- Advance Priority: 2
- Used to activate [Galeform Buff](#galeform-buff), has 2 charges with 30s CD.
- Upgrading this skill increases the damage that it buffs, which affects all damage sources, thus upgrade priority 2.

### Sharp Impact
![](./assets/c.png)

- Advance Priority: 4
- The skill's damage is negligible, used to activate the 15s [Wind Fury](#wind-fury) buff.
- When casting this skill while standing on the ground, your character will first teleport directly above your target and then crash down, this initial part of teleporting above the target has quite a long animation, but it can be skipped entirely by doing a jump before casting the skill. This jump cancel tech is incorporated as part of the [rotation](#rotation).

## Class Resources

### Courage

![](./assets/courage.png)
- Naturally recharges 3 per second.
- With [Galeform Buff](#galeform-buff) active, it recharges additionally 7 per second.
- When [Galeform Buff](#galeform-buff) is under [Wind Fury](#wind-fury), the additional 7 per second rechange changes to 10 per second.
- Galeform recharge ticks and natural recharge ticks are independent.

### Sharp

![](./assets/sharp.png)
- Each stack lasts 10 seconds, when it times out you will lose 1 stack, and when this happens it will still charge [Sharp Impact](#sharp-impact) by 5%.
- Each stack gives +5% attack, and for Aerial Wind Knight, having any stack will automatically give the max stack amount of attack bonus. This means (assuming all Sharp cap nodes are activated so Sharp cap is 6) having only 1 stack of Sharp will give `5% x 6 = 30%` Attack bonus.
- Due to this mechanism, you want to always keep 1 stack of Sharp. And DOT damages (i.e. tornado ticks) are calculated based on the time of the tick and not at the time of the initial tornado's creation, if you are unable to keep at least 1 stack of Sharp, your on field tornados' damage will suffer.

### Chasing Step

| 1 Stack               | 2 Stacks              |
|:----------------------|:----------------------|
| ![](./assets/jj1.png) | ![](./assets/jj2.png) |

- This buff is triggered when [Skyfall](#skyfall) crits, can stack up to 2 times.
- When a stack is consumed by [Instant Edge](#instant-edge) it refunds 1 [Sharp](#sharp).
- When a stack is consumed by [Instant Edge](#instant-edge) it doubles the amount of [Sharp Impact](#sharp-impact) charge.
    - A normal 3 [Sharp](#sharp) [Instant Edge](#instant-edge) charges 15% of [Sharp Impact](#sharp-impact), with this buff it will charge 30%.
- This is one of the main resource to speed up [Sharp Impact](#sharp-impact) charge, more will be explained in the [Rotation](#rotation) section.


## Key Buffs

### Wind Fury

- 15 second buff triggered by [Sharp Impact](#sharp-impact), increase damage dealt by 15%
- Increase [Courage](#courage) regen from [Galeform Buff](#galeform-buff).
- [Falcon Toss](#falcon-toss) becomes Azure Sever for 1 cast during the buff.
- [Instant Edge](#instant-edge) and Azure Sever will generate [Tornado](#tornado) during the buff.
    - If [Instant Edge](#instant-edge) is casted while standing on the ground it will perform 2 hits and both hits will each gerenate 1 [Tornado](#tornado).

### Galeform Buff

- 15 second buff that increase [Courage](#courage) regen and attack (via strength conversion), when activated the [Courage bar](#courage) will have a green outline around it.

![](./assets/galeformbuff.png)

- When this buff expires, it will trigger a secondary buff [Wind and Thunder](#wind-and-thunder). Galeform has to expire for this to trigger, if it gets refreshed before the buff expire it will not trigger until the new Galeform expires.

### Wind and Thunder

- 8 second buff that +12% Strength. You don't need to pay too much attention to this buff, just know that exists and play your rotation normally. You can see it in the buff bar as such:

![](./assets/windnthunder.png)

## Skill Tree

### Key Nodes

#### Tornado

![](./assets/tornado.png)
![](./assets/tornado1.png)

The in game description of tornado is very lacking, I'll explain in details how tornado actually works.

- Each tornado will stay on the field for 3 seconds, doing 1 tick of damage (per target) per second. Each tick of damage is 350% of attack, which means for a single target assuming every tick hits, 1 tornado has a motion value of 1050%.
    - After the 08/28 class balance update, the patch note says each tornado will have it's damage lowered by 20% after each hit, damage can be lowered till as low as 40% of attack. This means the MV of each tornado can go from 1050% to 40% if it hits enough enemies (non-single target scenario).
    - But what's actually implemented in the game is not the same as the patch note, the amount lowered per hit is actually 40%, not 20%. We don't know if this will get fixed and follow the patch note or if they will just adjust the description to match what's implemented.
- There can only be 3 tornados on the field at any given time, skills will not trigger more tornados nor refresh existing tornados when there are already 3 tornados on field.
- Tornado damage does not scale with any skill level nor with Melee DMG nor with Expertise Skill DMG.
- Tornado is one of the main damage sources. Skills that trigger tornados is explained under [Wind Fury](#wind-fury).

#### Instant Edge Combo Node

After the 08/28 class balance update this node changed from fixed 15% chance to the same chance as your lucky hit proc, which is your luck percentage. And the damage will be [Instant Edge's](#instant-edge) damage (with all its applicable multiplier) x Lucky Hit DMG multiplier. On my character with 4pc Lv60 [rune gear](#rune-gear) + Lv70 weapon, this multiplier is about 100%, which means whenever this procs [Instant Edge](#instant-edge) does 2x damage.

| Old                       | New                    |
|:--------------------------|:-----------------------|
| ![](./assets/iecombo.png) | ![](./assets/cnlj.png) |

#### Azure Sever Node

![](./assets/st_azure.png)

Enables Azure Sever, gain 3 stack of [Sharp](#sharp) on hit, see [Falcon Toss](#falcon-toss) and [Wind Fury](#wind-fury).

#### Chasing Step Node

![](./assets/st_chasingstep.png)

Enables [Chasing Step](#chasing-step)

![](./assets/st_chasingsteprefund.png)

Gain 1 stack of [Sharp](#sharp) when [Chasing Step](#chasing-step) is consumed.

#### Sharp Impact Node

Air Dance Strike
- Buffs [Courage](#courage) regen from [Galeform](#galeform-buff).
- Grants 3 [Sharp](#sharp) when [Sharp Impact](#sharp-impact) hits.

Typhoon: Sharp Impact
- The game does not explain this properly, this node will make [Sharp Impact](#sharp-impact) do an additional hit, and that additional hit will grant 3 more [Sharp](#sharp) on top of the 3 from Air Dance Strike.
- The main purpose of taking this node is to have 6 [Sharp](#sharp) right away after each [Sharp Impact](#sharp-impact).

![](./assets/st_sharpimpact3.png)

![](./assets/st_sharpimpact6.png)

#### Wind Fury Node

Enables [Wind Fury](#wind-fury).

![](./assets/st_windfury.png)

Enable double recharge for [Instant Edge](#instant-edge) with [Chasing Step](#chasing-step).

### Recommended Builds By Gear Level

#### Level 40 Gear Build

TLDR:
- Stat Priority: Crit >>> Haste > Mastery = Versatility >>> Luck
- [Skilltree](#day-19-level-60-talent-points-70)


Level 40 gears do not give enough crit to reach [40% Crit Rate](#40-crit-rate), with BiS gear we get to around 32-33%, so just use the same skilltree as [Day 19, Level 60, Talent Points 70](#day-19-level-60-talent-points-70), and build as much crit as possible.

This is what stat would look like with BIS gear and level 3 gems.

![](./assets/lv40stat.png)
(note: This does not account for any purple line on gear, and Haste is affected by Agility slightly, I use 280 Agility here for calculation, but this value could be higher.)

#### Level 60 Gear Build

##### Level 60 Normal Gear

TLDR:
- Stat Priority: Crit > Haste > Mastery = Versatility >>> Luck
- [Skilltree](#day-19-level-60-talent-points-70)


With level 60 gear we can barely reach [40% Crit Rate](#40-crit-rate), you'd need all the high crit rolls and crit 3rd roll and crit gems.
Skilltree is the same as [Day 19, Level 60, Talent Points 70](#day-19-level-60-talent-points-70), since we don't have enough luck to take advantage of [Instant Edge Combo](#instant-edge-combo-node) yet.

This is what stat would look like with BIS gear and level 5 gems. I also included an additional attack speed calculation if you have T0 [Celestial Flier](#celestial-flyer).

![](./assets/lv60stat.png)
(note: This does not account for any purple line on gear, and Haste is affected by Agility slightly, I use 280 Agility here for calculation, but this value could be higher.)

##### Level 60 Rune Gear and Level 70 Red Weapon

TLDR:
- Stat Priority: Crit (up till 40%) > Haste > Mastery = Versatility >>> Luck
- Skilltree: see below

With [rune gear](#rune-gear) and red weapon we have more than enough stat to reach [40% Crit Rate](#40-crit-rate), and the extra stat can be used for Haste, you do this with gems and by rerolling the 3rd roll of your gear.

BiS gear in this case is:
- Level 70 red weapon.
- Rune gear on Bracelet(L), because this slot does not roll crit.
- Rune gear on Bracelet(R), because this slot does not roll crit.
- Rune gear on Gauntlets, because this slot does not roll haste.
- Rune gear on Armor or Helmet, just pick whichever one has the worse stat from your own gear.

For BiS gear it's better to use 4 piece rune instead of 6, because you can get 1.5% strength purple line and Haste roll on the other 2 slots, which are much much better than the Luck that rune gear gives.

This is what stat would look like with BIS gear and level 5 gems. I also included an additional attack speed calculation if you have T0 [Celestial Flier](#celestial-flyer).

![](./assets/lv60runestat.png)
(note: This does not account for any purple line on gear, and Haste is affected by Agility slightly, I use 280 Agility here for calculation, but this value could be higher.)

Because we get 20+% crit from rune gear and red weapon, we swap Momentum Surge for [Instant Edge Combo](#instant-edge-combo-node).

![](./assets/skilltree.png)

##### Break Style vs Momentum Surge

Between Momentum Surge and Break Style, Break Style is generally better because of issues that Momentum Surge has.

Momentum Surge's effect is not active whenever we go in the air because we fly too high, that means our tornado damage will suffer everytime we go in the air (which happens quite often). Additionally this buff's calculation and application is delayed and affected by server lags, which further reduces its effectiveness. Momentum Surge is only strong on paper and has a lot of problems in practice.

#### Level 80 Gear Build

TODO:

## Rotation

Rotation for the recommended build is actually very simple. 
1. Use all available imagines, then [Galeform](#galeform).
2. Jump cancel into [Sharp Impact](#sharp-impact) (note: gives 6 [Sharp](#sharp) from [these nodes](#sharp-impact-node)).
3. Ground [Instant Edge](#instant-edge), then 3x [Skyfall](#skyfall).
4. Air [Instant Edge](#instant-edge) into ground [Instant Edge](#instant-edge).
5. [Azure Sever](#falcon-toss), then do 1-2x [Skyfall](#skyfall) until 6 stacks of [Sharp](#sharp) (note: Azure Sever gives 3 [Sharp](#sharp), from [this node](#azure-sever-node)).
6. Air [Instant Edge](#instant-edge) into ground [Instant Edge](#instant-edge).

### 40% Crit Rate

As long as you get 2 [Chasing Step](#chasing-step) procs out of the total 5 [Skyfalls](#skyfall) from step 3 and step 5, your [Sharp Impact](#sharp-impact) will be recharged by the end of step 6, and you can repeat the rotation from step 1 or 2 again. This is why you only need around 40% crit rate (`2 / 5 = 0.4`) to be able to play this rotation smoothly.

### Courage Management and Other Nuances

The are some nuances on [Courage](#courage) management, namely when to use [Galeform](#galeform) and ult ([Typhoon Cleave](#typhoon-cleave)). First of all you should remember these three numbers: 35, 70 and 105, these are amounts of the Courage needed to perform 1x, 2x and 3x [Skyfall](#skyfall).
- Let's say you are currently at step 2 of the rotation, and your Courage is greater than 105, then you know you can rotate until the end of step 3; and if in step 3 you got two [Chasing Step](#chasing-step) procs from the 3x [Skyfall](#skyfall), then you know you only have to do one [Skyfall](#skyfall) in step 5, which is 35 courage. At this time you can check if you have 35 courage while executing step 4, and decide if you need to use [Galeform](#galeform) before step 5. The mindset here is to delay using [Galeform](#galeform) enough so that you don't cap out on [Courage](#courage). When you are lucky (getting two [Chasing Step](#chasing-step) procs), you can generally delay more, since you don't have to do all five [Skyfall](#skyfall). When you are unlucky (getting zero [Chasing Step](#chasing-step) procs out of all five [Skyfall](#skyfall)), then you will most likely need to rely on ult to recover in order to not break rotation completely.
- On step 5, you can mix up the order of [Azure Sever](#falcon-toss) and [Skyfall](#skyfall) depending on the amount of Courage you have and the amount time left on [Galeform Buff](#galeform-buff).
    - If your Courage is about to reach 130 cap, then you want to use [Skyfall](#skyfall) to reach 3x [Sharp](#sharp) stacks first, then use [Azure Sever](#falcon-toss). This will avoid wasting Courage.
    - If [Galeform Buff](#galeform-buff) is about to end then you want to use [Azure Sever](#falcon-toss) first so that its damage gets buffed.
    - If there's currently no [Galeform Buff](#galeform-buff) active, and your Courage is low, then you can use [Galeform](#galeform), then use [Azure Sever](#falcon-toss), then [Skyfall](#skyfall) to fill up the remaining [Sharp](#sharp) stacks. Doing so ensures [Azure Sever's](#falcon-toss) damage is buffed and enough time to regen Courage for [Skyfall](#skyfall).
    - If there's already 3 tornados on the field, you can use [Skyfall](#skyfall) > [Azure Sever](#falcon-toss) > [Skyfall](#skyfall) to avoid [Azure Sever's](#falcon-toss) tornado not being generate due to on field tornado cap ([explained in tornado section](#tornado)).

There are many many more scenarios, as you play more you will start to get a feel for what you need to do.

## Gear and Stats

### Stats

#### Crit

We need 40% crit rate to be able to perform rotation as explained in [40% Crit Rate](#40-crit-rate). Once 40% is reached, stacking more crit doesn't provide as much value as other stats such as haste.

#### Haste

The purpose of stacking haste is to get higher attack speed, each percent of haste gives us 1.6% attack speed. But since raw haste value to haste percent conversion has diminishing return, and attack speed percent increase is linear, it's always better to build straight attack speed if possible.

Direct attack speed percent increase sources:
- Gear purple line
- Modules

We want to reach at least 20% attack speed, this will allow us to comfortably finish 1 rotation within 15s [Wind Fury](#wind-fury) duration, thus maintaining 100% uptime [Wind Fury](#wind-fury) uptime.

Personally I'd recommend building attack speed over 20%, since we currently still have times where [Courage](#courage) caps out, higher attack speed will allow us to convert the wasted [Courage](#courage) into damage. Though it is expected there to be a point where attack speed is too high and resource generation cannot keep up, I currently do not know where that point is yet.

For reference my character with Lv60 gear is at 25% attack speed, with up coming Lv80 gear it's expected to be higher.

#### Luck

With the 08/28 class balance update, luck will now somewhat scale, see [Instant Edge Combo](#instant-edge-combo-node), but the scaling is still very low. You get luck from [rune gear](#rune-gear) regardless, my recommendation is to try to get non-luck stat on other non-rune gear pieces, all other stats (crit, haste, mastery, versatility) scales better than luck.

### Rune Gear

When 20 man dragon raid becomes available (I think around 1 month after server goes live) rune gear will also become available.
- These gears are available on 6 of the slots: Helmet, Armor, Gauntlet, Boot, Bracelet(L), Bracelet(R).
- These gears will not have rng substat, it will always give the 2 thumbs up substats for your class and changes as you change class.
- Both substats will be high roll, unlike normal gear with 1 high 1 low roll.
- These gears will not have a purple line, and instead have a 2 piece and 4 piece set effect, these effects are different for different classes.
- For this class that means we will get crit and luck

### Lv60 Gear and Gems
- Get 6 piece [rune gear](#rune-gear)
- Reach 40% Crit
- Reach 20% Attack Speed
- Slot your gems and reforge your 3rd sub stat on gear based on what stat you are missing, if you have both 40% crit and 20% attack speed then I'd recommended going for haste for more attack speed.

### Lv80 Gear and Gems
- Get 4 piece [rune gear](#rune-gear)
- TODO: update crit, AS targets

- Muku Scout greatly outperforms Storm Goblin Warrior, as long as rotation is properly executed Muku Scout's buff will have 100% uptime.
- Muku Scout's description is not very accurate, but basically you just need to do damage at least 10 times per 5 seconds to maintain the buff, which is easily achiveable with my recommended stats and rotation.

### Celestial Flyer

Celestial Flier is also a good option for Skyward, even for f2p players. At lv0 it's comparable to lv5 Muku Scout over a 3 minute dummy parse, but in a lot of the content such as dungeons and 20 man raid it will out perform Muku Scout, because Scout will lose its passive stacks whenever boss enter mechanic.

If you are f2p you can use lv0 Flier with Muku Chief, and focus only on upgrading Muku Chief, leaving Flier at 0.

For Whales with both imagines being at lv5. Muku Chief, Goblin King and Celestial Flier, any 2 of those 3 imagines perform about the same, there doesn't seem to be a combination that greatly outperforms the others.

With that being said, Muku Chief is the most versatile, it can be used by pretty much all dps classes so it's great for people that play more than 1 class. Goblin King is pretty much only strong when it's high level, and it's pretty much only used by Skyward. Celestial Flier has the best price to performance ratio (best bang for your bucks) at low level (lv0, lv1), it can also be used by a few other classes (Moonstrike, Vanguard, etc).

## Modules

My recommendation:

- Damage Stack
    - This is better than pretty much all other modules and super hard to get, but if you have to sacrifice a lot of main stat and other module levels for it then it's not worth it.

- Strength
- Elite Damage
- Attack Speed
    - Higher priority if your attack speed is lower than 20%
- Crit
    - Crit mod gives you hp and Lv6 gives 12% crit damage, assuming you have Muku Chief Lv3 (19% crit dmg) and a 45% crit rate, then the actual increase of this mod would only be `((150 + 19 + 12) / (150 + 19) - 1) * 45% = 3.2%` a 3.2% increase. If your crit rate is lower or Muku Chief level is higher then the increase would be even lower.
- Agility
    - Gives flat physical attack, agility and physical damage increase. Agility also increase haste for this class.

Excluding Damage Stack, Strength is better than the rest, the other 4 recommendations are about the same.
Try to get 2 level 6s first, then try to go for 666 or 665 as an end goal. The additional mainstat from modules is also quite important so don't try to chase a certain level 6 and sacrifice a ton of main stat for it.
